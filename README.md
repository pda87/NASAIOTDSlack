# Slack-NASAIOTD
Uses the NASA API to retrieve NASA's Image Of The Day and then uses a Slack webhook to create a message and send the NASA IOTD to a channel. The channel information and Slack API etc is already set up in the Webook, which can be created on <a target=_blank href="http://api.slack.com">Slack's API</a>.
